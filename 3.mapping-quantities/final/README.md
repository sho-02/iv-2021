## Project 3: Mapping Quantities, Categories, and Summarized Data

My final mapping quantities poster series reflects on the environmental impacts of the US nuclear tests on the Marshall Islands. I used a radial map to organize the US nuclear tests by year and month, while analyzing their average yield. The posters are split into three separate compositions by location. The first is the nuclear test sites on Bikini Atoll, a total of 23 tests were conducted in this area. The second is Enewetak Atoll, where 43 nuclear tests were conducted at this site. Lastly, the final test was conducted near the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean, a grand total of 67 nuclear tests were conducted on the Marshall Islands, but what happened after they were deemed "complete"? The US built concrete dome structures around the islands to contain the nuclear waste and debris, but recently observers have noticed cracks and deterioration of these domes. Due to rising sea levels, these makeshift nuclear waste storage systems are beginning to break, resulting in a major environmental and health risk. The second series of posters examines the total yield of each year of the tests on the Marshall Islands, using the cracked lines around the domes to represent the impact these tests have had on the physical environment and long term effects the US have caused the Marshall Island residents.
