1) Abstract Analog
Based upon the quite universal analog clock, this system utilizes the hour and minute hands on a familiar analog clock to indicate the current hour. The circle along the "o'clock" arm represents the current minute. Reading from center outwards, the minutes range from zero to five. The minute circle can also be used to differentiate am from pm. A filled circle indicates pm and an empty circle means am. The seconds are represented by the radiating circle from the center of the composition. It begins in the center and grows larger with the number of seconds (zero through nine).

2) Brick-by-brick
This grid system is split by row for hour, minute, and seconds. The rows are further split into corresponding sections based on the category of time (twelve: hour, six: minutes, ten: seconds). Similar to the first system, 'Brick-by-brick' also utilizes color inversion to represent am or pm. Like most Western cultures, this system is read from left to right. The darker fill color is pm and lighter hue is am.

3) Fₙ Parody
This geometric block pattern uses rows and columns (like ex. 2) to separate hour, minute, and second. The outer most section, or reflected ninety degree angle, represents the hour. Split into twelve pieces, the hour begins from the bottom of the shape. It can be easier to read by counting the difference or what triangles are not filled in. The middle area is minutes, again split into its corresponding sections. The second to last, is the seconds and last is the time of day. The bottom right square of the pattern represents am or pm, blue-ish hue meaning pm and orange-ish meaning am.
